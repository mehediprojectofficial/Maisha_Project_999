# Changelog

All notable changes to HRIDOY-FCA will be documented in this file.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-07-19

### Changed
- Rebranded package from ST-FCA/stfca to HRIDOY-FCA/hridoy-fca (package.json, README, all source headers)
- Auto-update system now checks the `hridoy-fca` npm package/repo instead of the original author's

### Removed / Fixed
- Removed a background routine that silently fetched image-upload API keys from the original author's GitHub repo and used them to upload user images to that author's ImgBB/ImageKit accounts. Image upload keys are now read only from your own `config.json` (`imgKeys`), or omitted if not set.
- Fixed a syntax bug in `checkUpdate.js` (`packageJson.dependencies.hridoy-fca` is invalid JS for a hyphenated key — switched to bracket notation) that would have thrown at runtime during update checks.
